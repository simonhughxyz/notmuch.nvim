## Usage

Here are the core commands within Notmuch.nvim:

- **`:Notmuch`**: Lists available tags in your Notmuch database in a buffer.
  Setup key bindings for easy access. Example: 

  ```lua
  -- Define a keymap to run `:Notmuch` and launch the plugin landing page
  vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>n", "<CMD>Notmuch<CR>")
  ```

- **`:NmSearch <query>`**: Executes an asynchronous search based on provided
  Notmuch query terms.

  ```vim
  " Loads the threads in your inbox received today
  :NmSearch tag:inbox and date:today
  ```
